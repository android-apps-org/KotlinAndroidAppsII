# GDG Finder: Material Design

## Think About

```
As a result of an early focus in UX,
the platform got a head start in users willing to pay for higher quality apps.
Many developers thus opted into the iOS platform to take advantage of
the established user base and try and maximize earnings opportunities.
A lot has changed since then and Androidâ€™s Material Design concepts even have an effect on iOS apps.
Thinking about the applications you use every day, answer the following:
```
- What is the primary color schema?
- Is there consistency in the way it displays content across features?
- Is there a `voice` or `language` the app communicates that aligns with the brand?
- Does the app match other content (web/print/video/physical) by the brand?
- Thinking about interactions ...
  - Are the interactions readily recognizable?
  - Is there a pattern to how they are displayed? (primary/secondary/etc)
  - Can you tell which elements are interact-able and which are not?
