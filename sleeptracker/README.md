# Sleep Tracker: Persistence

## Think About

- When you open your favorite social media application, what data displays?
- After the initial load, does anything happen? If so, why?
- In applications that require login credentials, do you have to log in every time?
  - How might you accomplish similar behavior?
- In Airplane mode:
  - Do they function? Fully? Partially?
  - What data is still available?
  - How might that be stored?
  - Can you change data or interact with the functions in any way?
  - What happens when you turn airplane mode off?

## Debug
