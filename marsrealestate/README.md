# Connect to Internet

##  Think About

```
What is a mobile application that cannot obtain data in real time through the internet?  
While customers demand up to date and reliable data, not all access is created equal.  
Not only do developers have to be concerned with bandwidth due to data rates,  
but also connection speeds or availability altogether.  
Building upon the MVVM model lessons as well as persistence lessons, consider the following:
```
- What information do apps you use provide and where might that come from?
- What parameters do you provide to refine the data sets and find what you need?
- What images are stored within the app natively and what is downloaded remotely?
- Think about your favorite social media app:
  - Do you think your feed comes down all at once?
  - What data does the feed contain? Images?
- Think about a banking application:
  - Do you see all transactions for an account?
  - What parameters might be required to paginate transactions?
