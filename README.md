### Capstone Persistence

```
Depending on where you live in the world, 
data persistence might have different meaning to you personally, 
but as a developer, you need to make sure your application serves a global audience. 
Allowing basic app functionality while offline can help your users 
without consistent or reliable internet enjoy your app while offline 
while simultaneously increasing reliability and functionality. 
What features in your application absolutely need online data to operate, 
or can they use cached data to function and synchronize 
when an internet connection is available? 
Start to identify what data components you need for functionality 
and think about their structure, data types, and possible persistence options.
```

### Capstone Connect
```
The power of mobile applications is their ability to be used on the go. 
As mobile internet access continues to spread throughout the globe, 
users increasingly expect access to data wherever they are. 
For your application, what data will need to be retrieved online? 
Have you found a source for that data? 
APIs are available for a number of different types of data, 
but not all are free or well documented and easy to use. 
Start thinking about where data you might need to enable your features to work. 
Look into various APIs and develop a plan to connect and retrieve that data. 
Think about queries you might need to build to retrieve that data.
