# Android Apps in Kotlin Part II

### Capstone Component

```
Depending on where you live in the world, 
data persistence might have different meaning to you personally, 
but as a developer, you need to make sure your application serves a global audience. 
Allowing basic app functionality while offline can help your users 
without consistent or reliable internet enjoy your app while offline 
while simultaneously increasing reliability and functionality. 
What features in your application absolutely need online data to operate, 
or can they use cached data to function and synchronize 
when an internet connection is available? 
Start to identify what data components you need for functionality 
and think about their structure, data types, and possible persistence options.
