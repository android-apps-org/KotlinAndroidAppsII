### Capstone Persistence

```
Depending on where you live in the world, 
data persistence might have different meaning to you personally, 
but as a developer, you need to make sure your application serves a global audience. 
Allowing basic app functionality while offline can help your users 
without consistent or reliable internet enjoy your app while offline 
while simultaneously increasing reliability and functionality. 
What features in your application absolutely need online data to operate, 
or can they use cached data to function and synchronize 
when an internet connection is available? 
Start to identify what data components you need for functionality 
and think about their structure, data types, and possible persistence options.
```

### Capstone Connect
```
The power of mobile applications is their ability to be used on the go. 
As mobile internet access continues to spread throughout the globe, 
users increasingly expect access to data wherever they are. 
For your application, what data will need to be retrieved online? 
Have you found a source for that data? 
APIs are available for a number of different types of data, 
but not all are free or well documented and easy to use. 
Start thinking about where data you might need to enable your features to work. 
Look into various APIs and develop a plan to connect and retrieve that data. 
Think about queries you might need to build to retrieve that data.
```

###  Capstone Offline

```
As you have seen previously, data persistence adds extreme value to almost any application.
With Room, you can benefit from the power of online data access and flexibility of local persistent storage.
With the APIs youâ€™ve looked at for your app ideas, what would the entities look like locally?
Start a plan for developing your API models for storage.
```

Capstone Design

```
Early on, the Android ecosystem suffered from apps with inconsistent UI and usability standards.  
Apps were generally considered inferior to their iOS counterparts or even versions.  
Today, a solid UX is a cornerstone of any successful app.  
Start planning a design strategy for your application.  
What colors are you going to use? How are you going to space content?  
Can you put together resources, colors, dimensions, drawables, styles, and themes,  
  that will produce the desired effect?
