# Offline Caching

## Think About
```
What is a mobile application that cannot obtain data in real time through the internet?
While customers demand up to date and reliable data, not all access is created equal.  
Not only do developers have to be concerned with bandwidth due to data rates,  
but also connection speeds or availability altogether.  
Building upon the MVVM model lessons as well as persistence lessons, consider following:
```

- What information do apps you use provide and where might that come from?
- What parameters do you provide to filter the results?
- When you enter data, what might the POST call look like?
- Are you able to enter data offline or maybe cellular data, but then back up when on WiFi?
- How would you go about achieving that behavior?
